  <p>San Francisco city has been always high in happening crime rates; among them vehicle thefts is one of the most common crimes reported to the police. For this assignment I choose to dig up with Vehicle theft category.

   <h2> The choropleth map</h2>

   <p>
For better understand of the distribution of vehicle thefts across San Francisco, I looked at the number of thefts in each of the city's districts. I made a choropleth map which shows the number of vehicle thefts in each district from 2003 to 2018.
<br>
According to the data, the district with the highest number of vehicle thefts is the Ingleside district which is in the southern part of the city, with around more than 20k thefts over the years. The second highest district for vehicle thefts is the Mission district, with around more than 17k thefts over the years.
<br>
The third highest district in terms of vehicle thefts is the Bayview district, with more than 16k thefts incidents over the 15years period. The Bayview district is also situated in southern part of the city.
On the other hand, the district with the lowest number of vehicle thefts is the Tenderloin district, with exactly 2370 vehicle theft incidents. The Tenderloin district is located in the north-east part of the city.

    <h2>The Polar Bar</h2>

<p>
The polar bar shows the relationship between the hour of the day and the frequency of vehicle theft incidents in San Francisco between 2003 and 2018.  The frequency of vehicle theft is higher during the evening period, between 6PM to 12PM and decreasing in the early morning hours..<br>

   <h2>The Interactive plot</h2>
   ![bokeh_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123973370/228150911-844c02db-9233-4989-9923-29beefaa0d26.png)
<p>
  The Interactive plot above shows the continuity in vehicle thefts in different districts of San Francisco over 15years. The data used in this graph is obtained from the San Francisco Police Department's Incident Reports from 2003 to 2018. This plot is based on the number of vehicle thefts reported in each district of San Francisco over the years between 2003 to 2017.
<br>
In 2006, there was a noticeable amount of decrease in the numbers of vehicle thefts across the districts, possibly because of the implementation of police force by the city of San Francisco to prevent vehicle theft. But there was a increase in vehicle thefts in 2015. The overall report in vehicle theft varies across the different districts in San Francisco. The districts of southern, Richmond and central show a similar pattern, around 1500 incidents in 2003 and 2004. And from 2006 to 2015 there are noticeable drop of events. Taraval, Bayview, Northern, Mission also shows similar pattern. INGLESIDE has the highest number of cases and TENDERLOIN consistently has the lowest number of cases.
